## Introduction

League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games where players participate with four teammates in head-tohead matches and the goal is to destroy the opposing teams nexus. Each player in a match–usually lasting between twenty minutes and an hour–controls a unique champion chosen from a pool of more than a hundred with differing characteristics and abilities. The game boasts 100 million monthly players and a flourishing competitive scene with millions in tournament prize pools as well as online viewers. With such a large community behind League of Legends, predicting match outcomes for casual players and tournament games
alike would be interesting and valuable to players and fans. Such a system would also provide insight into
particular features that are influential in swaying win probability.

### A. Game Overview
In a standard League of Legends match, two teams of five players each face off on a map called the Summoner’s Rift. Each player has a choice of playing one of 133 champions for the duration of a single match as well as customizing their initial stats and abilities by choosing two summoner spells (out of ten) and
selecting sets of ”masteries” and runes which effectively cause various increases to stats like more health
regeneration or bonus characteristics such as moving
faster when attacking an enemy. A typical game also
sees the division of players on single team into distinct
roles that they play throughout the game.

### B. Related Work
As League of Legends is a popular game, there are
already a couple of applications that exist in the data
analysis sphere. Websites like League of Graphs and
MetaSrc collect basic stats and information from the
League of Legends API and use it to construct simple
analyses like what the most popular champion and what
the win rate of two champions when played together
are. What these existing applications do not currently
do is prediction of a currently ongoing game with all
of the features of that game in mind, and that is the
hole that this project is attempting to fill.
